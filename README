Twilio-Pisco-Sour

Introduction

This is a simple example of a Twilio Call/SMS Response App using Java Play Framework
This App is 110% inspired by Michael Wawra's (aka @xmjw) excellent Twilio blog post/tutorial:
https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/08/play-with-twilio.html indeed I'm only posting the code because I don't think Michael 
has got around to doing so yet (he's a very busy bunny). If you like this you should also checkout:

Dependencies

This App requires: 

That you have Play 2.3 installed. Please see http://www.playframework.com/download or
http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Installing for more information.

A Twilio account (you should definitely have one of these already, shame on you if not! ;-)   ) 
Please see: http://twilio.com/try-twilio to create an account & for more information.

Ngrok . Please see https://ngrok.com/ for more information.

Instructions

1) Clone/Copy/Fork/Download the files in this repo to your corresponding Play App folder structure. 
2) Install the Twilio dependencies for Play by typing 'activator dependencies' at the command line.
3) Start ngrok as per your preference, for example typing 'ngrok 9000' at the command line will start ngrok on port 9000
4) Start your Play App by typing 'activator run' at the command line in the root folder of your Play App.
5) Configure your Twilio number to point to 'your ngrok forwarding url'/calls for Voice & 
'your ngrok forwarding url'/messages for Messaging.
6) Make a call and/or send an SMS to your Twilio number!

Confirmation of correct operation

If everything is working as intended, you should receive an announcement in response to a voice call to your Twilio number, 
or an SMS reply in response to an SMS. You should also see a '200 OK' message in the console window where ngrok is running:

HTTP Requests                                                         
-------------                                                         
                                                                      
POST /calls                   200 OK                                  
POST /messages                200 OK       

Troubleshooting

If you experience any problems with the App please follow the instructions in any error message received in the first
instance (i.e. Google the error message to find the solution). The Twilio & Play websites (see above) are also invaluable 
sources of information, debugging tools etc.

If all else fails please feel free to contact me & I'll do the best I can to help! :-)
